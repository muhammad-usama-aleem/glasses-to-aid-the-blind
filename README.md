# glasses-to-aid-the-blind

in this project, I decided to make the program which can help the blind to recognize the person, objects and then tell the blind person in the ear through ear piece what was detected.

we will be using  
1- A pair of glasses
2- A raspberry pi 
3- 3mm camera
4- headphones/ear piece

to make this program work you will be needing two files named as "yolov3.cfg" and "yolov3.weights". I have attached the one file here and other file you can download from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-e8s1mF_QAlGSRbBX3b0JcWmWQtmVjNe

this project is still in progress phase.
will appriciate any kind of help in coding.
