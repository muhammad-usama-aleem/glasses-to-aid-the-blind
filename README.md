to make this program work you will be needing two files named as "yolov3.cfg" and "yolov3.weights". I have attached one file named as "yolov3.cfg" here and other file named as "yolov3.weights" you can download from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1-e8s1mF_QAlGSRbBX3b0JcWmWQtmVjNe

this project is still in progress phase.
will appriciate any kind of help in coding.
