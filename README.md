# glasses-to-aid-the-blind

in this project, I decided to make the program which can help the blind to recognize the person, objects and then tell the blind person in the ear through ear piece what was detected.<br />

the goggles 3D model that I created will look like this.

<br />
to make this program work you will be needing three files named as "yolov3.cfg", "coco.names" and "yolov3.weights".<br /> I have attached two file named as "yolov3.cfg" and "coco.names" here and other file named as "yolov3.weights" you can download from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-e8s1mF_QAlGSRbBX3b0JcWmWQtmVjNe

this project is still in progress phase.
will appriciate any kind of help in coding.
